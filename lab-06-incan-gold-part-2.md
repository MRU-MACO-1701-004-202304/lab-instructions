# Lab-06: Incan Gold, Revisited

**Can we just make one small change? It'll probably be real easy, right?**

## Overview

One thing you do a lot when programming for a living is adding features that your customers (boss, research advisor, etc.) think are a Good Idea.

So let's get a taste of that.

## Assumptions

I'm assuming you've worked through and are reasonably comfortable with the topics and skills covered in prior labs and lectures.

## Python language focus

The focus of this lab is the same as last lab:

- User input
- Data types
- Operators, especially `%` and `//`
- Formatted output via `f-Strings`

In addition, you should try to use `constants` in your code this time.

## Step 1: Understand the problem

The customer thought it'd be cool to have 2 different type of gems now; `red gems` worth 3 points and `blue gems` worth 1 point. So now a room can have these two different types of gems - each type should be distributed evenly, just as before.

Because of this change, your job is to modify your previous application so that it now figures out how to properly split **each type of gem** in a given room equally between the players in that room - and also figure out how many gems of each type get left behind. **And** you'll now need to calculate how many points each player will receive.

Customers. Yay.

### before you just "dive in"

_Think of some different scenarios that you could use to check your algorithm. Don't skip this._

## Step 2: Design an algorithm

Don't just start modifying your prior code - there are some wrinkles here that are not immediately apparent.

Take the time to sketch out a new algorithm that addresses the new features you've been asked to implement.

Don't forget to give your algorithm a test drive or two.

## Step 3: Implement your algorithm

This shouldn't take long, because you're just translating your algorithm (which you've tested). Right?

**Unlike the last lab, this lab now provides you with an opportunity to use `constants` - can you see where?**

## Step 4: Test your algorithm

Run your program with the test data you've created. If you think it's working as expected, feel free to call your instructor over to have a look!
