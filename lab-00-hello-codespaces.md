# Lab-00

**A brief encounter with GitHub Codespaces.**

## A Bit of Background

GitHub Codespaces are "fully configured dev environments in the cloud". At least according to their landing page.

## Instructions

The following exercises will introduce you to a workflow you will use with all labs this semester, as well as most of your assignments.

The sooner you get the hang of this, the better - it's much more fun to actually learn how to solve problems with a programming language than to wrestle with the plumbing needed to actually start programming!
