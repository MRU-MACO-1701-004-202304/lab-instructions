# Lab-00: Hello, Codespaces

**A brief encounter with GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Classroom.**

## What's a Codespace?

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) are "fully configured dev environments in the cloud", at least according to their PR department.

I tend to think of a Codespace as a little mini-computer I can access through a web-browser that has software I need for programming pre-installed on it. Which I guess is the same thing that the PR department is saying, but with more words. That's why I'm not in PR. 

## What's GitHub Classroom?

[GitHub Classroom](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/get-started-with-github-classroom/about-github-classroom) is a "teaching tool that lets teachers...create and manage...assignments". 

It's used by some instructors (like me) to distribute lab and assignment content.

## Overview

The steps below will introduce you to a workflow you will use with all labs - and most assignments - this semester.

The sooner you get the hang of this workflow, the better - it's much more fun to actually learn how to solve problems with a programming language than to wrestle with plumbing.

## Do These Things

These instructions aren't super-detailed, because such instructions tend to "rot" quickly. 
If you have any questions or issues, ask!

**You're not going to break anything by making a "wrong" choice here, so don't freak out.**

### Step 01: Get the content for this lab

**_First order of business: get your own copy of the content for the lab._**

1. Log in to GitHub.

2. Go to our [GitHub Classroom Content Links page](https://github.com/MRU-MACO-1701-004-202304/github-classroom-content-links).

    _**pro tip:** You're going to go here a lot, so bookmark it._

3. Click on the `get content` link to start The Process.

4. Click on the Star button to "star" your repo; this will make it much easier to get to it in the future. ![star the repo](./images/lab-00-star-repo.png)


### Step 02: Open the content in a Codespace

**_Next up: create your own "mini-computer" to do your work._**

1. Go to your lab-00 repo. (If you just finished step 01, you should be there already, but if you've gotten turned around, go back to your GitHub home page and choose the Stars tab.) ![getting to stars](./images/lab-00-getting-to-stars.png)

2. Click on the `<> Code` button ➀, then choose the Codespaces tab ➁, and finally select `Create codespace on main` ➂ ~![opening a codespace](./images/lab-00-opening-a-codespace.png)

### Step 03: Make a change to the content on that Codespace

### Step 04: Move the changes to someplace more permanent

### Step 05: Sanity check
