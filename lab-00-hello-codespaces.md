# Lab-00

**A brief encounter with GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Classroom.**

## What's a Codespace?

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) are "fully configured dev environments in the cloud", at least according to their PR department.

I tend to think of a Codespace as a little mini-computer I can access through a web-browser that has software I need for programming pre-installed on it. Which I guess is the same thing that the PR department is saying, but with more words. That's why I'm not in PR. 

## What's GitHub Classroom?

[GitHub Classroom](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/get-started-with-github-classroom/about-github-classroom) is a "teaching tool that lets teachers...create and manage...assignments". 

It's used by some instructors (like me) to distribute lab and assignment content.

## Overview

The steps below will introduce you to a workflow you will use with all labs - and most assignments - this semester.

The sooner you get the hang of this workflow, the better - it's much more fun to actually learn how to solve problems with a programming language than to wrestle with plumbing.

## Do These Things

### Step 01: Get the content for this lab

### Step 02: Open up the content in a Codespace

### Step 03: Make a change to the content on the Codespace

### Step 04: Make your changes visible to JP

### Step 05: Sanity check
