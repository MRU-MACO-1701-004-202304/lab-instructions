# Lab-01: Algorithms and Tracing

**Creating algorithms and tracing them are critical, fundamental skills.**

## Overview

You won't be programming in Python for this lab (don't worry, you will be soon enough). Instead you'll be practicing reading and writing some algorithms.

## Assumption

I assume you've successfully completed [Lab-00: Hello, Codespaces](https://github.com/MRU-MACO-1701-004-202304/github-classroom-content-links).

If that's not the case, complete that lab before starting this one.

## Do These Things

### Step 01: Get the content for this lab

Get the content for this lab from the GitHub Classroom content page for our course. _I'm not linking to it on purpose, as I'd like you to remember on your own where to find it._

Don't forget to "star" your resulting repo. _Why should we do that?_

### Step 02: Open the content in a Codespace

The resulting Codespace is super-boring. But you're about to change that.

### Step 03: Create a file on your Codespace to hold your work

1. Create a file called `exercises.txt` in your Codespace. I won't tell you exactly how to do this, but I'll give you a hint: you'll need to start by clicking on the Explorer icon in your Codespace
